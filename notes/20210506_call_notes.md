**Description:**
The selection of licenses for data and metadata hosted in repositories, shared by researchers, and reused by end users necessarily reflects an attempt to balance a variety of interests. A sample of these interests includes researcher interest in receiving proper attribution for their work in creating data, sponsor interests in maximizing the impact of the support they provide, repository interests in having the necessary rights to manage and provide access to data and metadata they host, and end user interests in being able to use the data they find with minimal restrictions and requirements. This DataONE Community Call will bring together the community and a group of invited participants to discuss the lessons learned and decisions made in selecting data licenses for use in a variety of contexts.
