**Description:** Schema.org provides a simple mechanism to include machine readable, structured metadata in human readable web pages, including descriptions of Dataset entries on dataset landing pages. The metadata is readily accessible using common web tools, and is actively harvested by large scale, generalist, commercial indexers (e.g. Google). DataONE will soon be indexing schema.org metadata as an alternative pathway for repositories to participate in the DataONE federation. The flexibility of schema.org means it can be used to describe many resources including scientific datasets, but that flexibility also enables potentially incompatible approaches for constructing such metadata. The ESIP Science-On-Schema.org group has produced an evolving set of guidelines to assist with consistent implementation of scientific dataset descriptions using the schema.org vocabulary. This community call will introduce the Science-on-schema.org guidelines, highlight additional resources available for working with schema.org, and include experiences of some that have implemented the guidelines for their repositories.
