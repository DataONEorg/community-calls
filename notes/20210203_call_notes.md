[![hackmd-github-sync-badge](https://hackmd.io/npMXMuvsTAuXHC8-mjomkQ/badge)](https://hackmd.io/npMXMuvsTAuXHC8-mjomkQ)

**Topic**: How can DataONE interact with emerging networks

**Description**: Many of us participate in multiple cyberinfrastructure, disciplinary, and
professional networks as part of our daily work. While these networks frequently provide 
complementary resources and capabilities there are cases where there might be duplicative 
efforts or capabilities that coordination between networks might help reduce (if 
appropriate). This community call will bring together panelists from multiple 
networks that have some degree of existing connectivity with the DataONE network and 
community and start a discussion focused on opportunities for collaborative and coordinated 
activities that can efficiently meet and provide cost-effective solutions for shared 
community needs while contributing to increased sustainability of network capabilities.
