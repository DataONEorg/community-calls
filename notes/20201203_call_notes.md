### Notes

- Are there challenges in the community regarding how to navigate the complexity of information and resources that exist?
    - MB: It can be hard to navigate.
    - How could the DMTC search be updated? What methods do you use?
    - Crowdsource efforts. Largely exploratory.
    - Would feedback ratings support use / understanding materials?
    - RCO:  Metrics are helpful.
- How does the DMTC collect resources?
    - Both based on submissions from creators and also graduate intern support to add resources (funded thtough IMLS)
    - DMTC Resource Contribution Page: https://dmtclearinghouse.esipfed.org/submit
- DD: Have used DataONE education modules a lot. Would be interesed in exploring translation to Portugese. Connecting to FAIR community could enhance the clearinghouse and materials.
    - Have been explosing FAIR in terms of documentation of content 
-  How does the DMTC handle changing (dynamic) curriculum? Use case of the [DataONE/NCEAS short course](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/learning-hub/short-course).
    -  Haven't built this into current rpocess. It's a challenge. Continued availability is imporant - beyond standard link checking.
-  Does the DMTC index in person 'events' vs curriculua / resources?
    -  No, also assessmengt piece ties in to this
    -  Largely a metadata challenge - are resources intended for in-person events, self instruction etc?
    -  Leah Wasser started in on this type of classification to indexing against in person events when she was at NEON
-  Q for Amber: Do you have an ongoing list of in development materials for the dataONE education hub?
    -  I think you are referring to the modules in GitHub: https://dataoneorg.github.io/Education/githubdirect. That's right, if we have ideas for additional modules, can we post there somewhere? Yes! See https://dataoneorg.github.io/Education/contribute Great thanks!!
