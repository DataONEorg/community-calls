**Description**: Many of us participate in multiple cyberinfrastructure, disciplinary, and
professional networks as part of our daily work. While these networks frequently provide 
complementary resources and capabilities there are cases where there might be duplicative 
efforts or capabilities that coordination between networks might help reduce (if 
appropriate). This community call will bring together panelists from multiple 
networks that have some degree of existing connectivity with the DataONE network and 
community and start a discussion focused on opportunities for collaborative and coordinated 
activities that can efficiently meet and provide cost-effective solutions for shared 
community needs while contributing to increased sustainability of network capabilities.

2. Discussion of next steps to move forward on near-term opportunities for network collaboration (Open discussion about connectivity and collaboration opportunities (10 min - Karl)

**Potential Framing questions for discussion - add your own**

* Where are the productive boundaries and connections between the infrastructure developed and maintained by different Earth science networks?
* What are the benefits and costs of shared infrastructure? Is there more than infrastructure to share?
* What interoperability models can be used to build connections between networks?
* How can we leverage existing network connections - shared individual participation, overlapping organizational memberships, common sponsors, common use of interoperabilty standards?
