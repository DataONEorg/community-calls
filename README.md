# DataONE Community Calls

[DataONE](https://dataone.org) holds a [DataONE community call](https://dataone.org/community-calls) approximately monthly to discuss issues and topics of relevance to the DataONE network. These are open for anyone to attend and help promote shared approaches to research data management centered on DataONE as a global data sharing network. Topics focus on issues that are central to data preservation and resuse for repositories, researchers, and others engaged in research data management. This repository is used to gather input and ideas for topics for these community calls. Community Calls are 1 hour long, typically include a short presentation or two to set the stage for discussion, and then focus on discussion for the remainder of the call. Topics focus on issues of importance to the DataONE network of repositories from both a repository perspective and a researcher perspective. 

## What are your ideas for a DataONE Community Call? 

We ask for your ideas for [DataONE Community Call](https://dataone.org/community-calls) topics and speakers, as well as your feedback on how to refine a topic to be most useful to the community, and votes on which of the proposed topics should be prioritized for upcoming calls. Topics might focus on issues such as onboarding new repositories into the network, data discovery and access features from the [DataONE Search](https://search.dataone.org) system, and interoperability issues that span repositories and researchers. We're open to many topics and ideas that are relevant to growing and maintaining the DataONE community and our collective tools and services.

## How to contribute your ideas

We‚Äôve [opened an issue in this repository for each topic we‚Äôre considering](https://github.com/DataONEorg/community-calls/issues). Please provide your input on these by adding comments to the issue that refine and expand the topic, suggest speakers or resources, or take the discussion in a new direction. We welcome participation and civil conversations that adhere to our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DataONEorg/community-calls/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).
